Sam returns to the Pure shores with the fabulously uplifting and driving Life In Trance which is taken from Stoneface & Terminal Disc 2 of Pure Trance Vol. 9. Mr. Laxton never fails to deliver when he turns up the energy knobs and Life In Trance is a personal musical statement of all that he loves about this side of the sound we all love so much.
