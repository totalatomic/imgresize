Skirting the edges of Balearic trance and progressive house comes Austin’s Samuel Wangsness a.k.a. Foxhill with the blissed-out Waiting on the Beach. Sam is something of a nomad and on occasion he pauses in his travels to write gorgeous music, which we are lucky enough to release on our labels. 2016 gave us the seminal Supermassive and now 6 years later we’re again treated to something rather special that rolls along at 120bpm with strolling bass, sun-drenched strings, nostalgic piano and haunting synths atop a Mediterranean rhythm section and clocks in at just shy of 10 minutes. This is music to make memories.
